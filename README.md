# Falling Prediction using KNN

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which relies on labled input data to learn how to label an unknown data and can be used for both regression and classification problems.
 
In the falling prediction problem we are going to use data points with (X-Y-Z) coordinate from sensors and classify whether a new unlabeled point is in the class of fall(-) or not.
