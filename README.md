# Model Evaluation Using Overfitting

Regression models are used to model a relationship between the dependant and independent variables. When data shows a curvy trend this relationship is non-linear otherwise the relationship is linear.

One important parameter to choose a model is overfitting. Overfit regression models correspond to training data too closely and therefore fail to generalize on test data.
